# SLNTools (Solution Tools)

A helpful utility for managing Visual Studio solutions.

Key features include:
* Compare 2 solution files and report the differences
* Merging solution files from source control
* Create a filtered solution from a larger solution.  This comes in handy when you have one large solution that you want to break into smaller solutions for specific functionality.

## Building the solution
.Net Framework 4.0 or greater is necessary to build the solution.  

Start "SLNTools.BuildReleaseVersion.cmd", the result will be put in the "bin\Release" subfolder.

## Solution information
This is a Visual Studio 2017 solution.  The Wix Toolset is used to create the installer.  You can download it here: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102
